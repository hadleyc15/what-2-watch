## **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
>The purpose of this project is to collaboratively develop a full-stack application that meets a real-world need. The project should include a quality user story
and acceptance criteria to aid development.The group should combine a robust back end—with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication—to an intuitive front end
The group is expected to present the project and convince an audience that it serves a purpose. Full project and presentation requirements are detailed below.  

> The COVID-19 Pandemic, the Black Lives Matter Movement, and natural phenomenons such as earthquakes and fires, have quickly moved to the forefront of concern across the world. As a result, Americans are turning to video streaming entertainment platforms such as Netflix to escape from the troubles around them and enjoy an evening of relief.

> What2Watch is an online application designed to aid Netflix watchers in determining what to watch.  Friends can log into What2Watch to nominate their movie choice for the week and others can vote on the nominees to determine a winner.
